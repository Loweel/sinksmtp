Sinksmtp is a 'sink' SMTP server, one that talks SMTP and potentially
captures incoming email, but doesn't do anything with any email it
captures except log it to disk.  The author uses it to capture incoming
spam to what are now spamtrap addresses.

Sinksmtp supports TLS if configured, among other things.

Sinksmtp supports a number of ways to filter and select what incoming
SMTP transactions can get as far as submitting messages and which ones
are refused earlier. The author uses this to filter out uninteresting
spam and spam sources in his spamtrap server.

See doc.go / godoc for the detailed documentation.

Sinksmtp uses my smtpd Go package[*] to handle the low level details
of SMTP serving. It was previously part of the source repo for that
package, as a usage example, but it has considerably outgrown being a
simple usage example and has now moved into a separate repo.

There are some fancier packages that may be better alternatives to
sinksmtp for things like accepting email for testing or as a logging
mechanism for systems that don't have anything else.  The ones that I
know of are:
	https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog
	http://mailslurper.com/

A feature for both of these is a web interface that let you see and
browse the received email messages. Sinksmtp just dumps any email into
the filesystem, where it's up to you to monitor it and pull it out.
